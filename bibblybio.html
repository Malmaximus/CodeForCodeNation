<h2> A little bit about me  </h2>




<h3>My experience so far</h3>

<p>My experience so far with coding is currently quite minimal as of (06/09/2020). <br>
I have viewed some learning material in my own personal time and <br>
i have undergone a short coding course with Code Nation.<br>
<br>
Sadly due to some personal reasons it was quite the exhausting experience to study coding<br>
under the conditions it was learnt in but i do not regret undertaking the challenge.<br>

As of this moment i plan on learning how to use the knowledge i have gained in a <br>
practical employment sense as i don't yet know how to get employment in the field.</p>

<h3>Why i joined Code Nation</h3>

<p> I joined Code Nation because it was providing a beginners course in learning how to code.<br>
I consider knowledge to be an extremely valuable personal asset and with the majority of <br>
the information in this age being solely accessable in a digital format it seemed necessary<br>
to become digitally literate.<br>
<br>
For more information from Code Nation please click <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/"> HERE.</a>
</p>
        
<h3>My Background</h3>      

<p>I have some work experience in both retail and sales and i graduateed university with <br>
a BEngHons Aerospace Engineering Degree. <br>
From the desire to maintain some degree or personal freedom and financial wellbeing i've <br>
been recently persuing a software development career to improve my ability to earn a <br>
desirable chashflow from home whilst the economy continues to falter.  </p>
