<p>
    Importance of it in bussiness:
    Decision making is effected by;
    -market research, 
    -data manipulation,
    -Predictions that can't be made without mass number crunching.

    market and business growth;
    reaching a large volume of audience,
    expand customer base to potentially whole planet
    greatest trust/confidence for remote purchasing ever.

    customer support and satisfaction;
    (improved customer comunication)
    able to recieve customer feedback at 24/7
    able to improve the ease for customers to provide feedback
    possible to provide ease of purchase- increasing revenue

    resource management;

    able to keep track of resourses such as time or finances
    Able to coordinate globaly if needed which; -

<h3>
    1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources
    needed to complete digital projects successfully –
    what do you need to make projects successful?
    What tools? What skills?
</h3>

<div class="u1o1">
<h4>To complete digital projects successfully you'll need to consider</h4>

    <ol>
    The methods used:
    There are a number of potential methods used such as 
        <li>Scrum Project Management</li>
        <li>Extreme Programming</li>
        <li>Adaptive Project Framework (APF)</li>
        <li> But the one i've personally used for this<br>
             project is Kanban style Project Management.</li>   
    </ol>
    
    <ul>
        Some of the skills required:
        <li>Reading and understanding code is useful for many digital projects in 
            presumably the same way being able to read words is useful when trying to write a book.
         </li>
        <li>Team-work/coordination is often beneficial as most large projects can benefit from having 
            more than one person working on it presuming synergy is achieved.
        </li>
        <li>Time/resource management</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        Some useful resources:
        <li>VS CODE</li>
        <li>GITHUB</li>
        <li>Trello</li>
        <li>Jay's free time</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
    1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making
    your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to
    your trello board.
</h3>
<p>
    The Majority of the planning was done via chunking the work using the IT tool "Trello"'s<br>
    checklist function. As the project assignment was already broken down into 2 units with<br>
     3 sections each, it was decided to attempt to complete the written work in order after <br>
    encoding the basic functionality of the website.<br>

<h3>
    1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital
    projects – what causes digital projects to fail?
    Why?
</h3>
<p>
        There are more potential risks than i have time to write about but the greatest<br>
        risk (in my opiniton) is mis-organisation of resources.<br>
        Time is a greatly important resourse to consider when planning and working on <br>
        a digital project, and although it can be difficult to accurately plan for time <br>
        wehn dealing with working on unsolved problems, it is always important to pay it<br>
        due consideration.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
    1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting
    and using IT systems and software – how do you
    select the right kind of technology for the job?
    
</h3>
<p>
        To select the right kind of technology for any job, be it a large scale team project <br>
        or a personal one it will be requied to assess the needs of the project itself.<br>
        Reviewing the avaliable softwares and technologies after determining the requirements <br>
        of the project would be the next logical step.<br>
        Once the most compatible software and technology for the requirements of the project has<br>
        been determined, it will usually be selected.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
    1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your
chosen technologies have helped you achieve
your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan
and how can git and GitHub help with your codes
version control
</h3>
<p>
        Trello has assisted in providing a clear and easy to understand Kanban style set<br>
        of working criteria. <br>
        Trellos's capability to allow for the creation of checklists has also been useful<br> in breaking down this project into slighly more manageable parts<br>

        GitHub has yet to be used at this stage of the project but if this was a team <br> project it's ability to save multiple versions of a file after each editing session<br> could of proved very useful in a teams sharing of work or rolling back to an old<br> version if some of the newly contributed work is incompattible with the projects<br> final desired product.

<h3> 
1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that
impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact
digital projects?
</h3>


<div class="u1o1">

There are manny legal guidlines and constraints that can impact digital projects;
one of the most prominent ones as of late ( since May 25<sup>th</sup>, 2018) is 
called the "General Data Protection Regulation" or for short hand "GDPR". <br>
<br>
<br>
"GDPR"<br>
    How does this affect digital projects?
    Due to the GDPR,  processors and controllers (in general handelers) of personal data must put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to implement data protection principles to ensure the fair and proper use of an induviduals personal data.<br>
    Failure to follow these "guidlines" and constraints can have those who are liable facing significant fines. <br>

    <q>Infringements of the following provisions shall, in accordance with paragraph 2, be subject to administrative fines up to 10 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 2 % of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher</q>
