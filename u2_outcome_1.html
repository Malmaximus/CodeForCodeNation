<h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each
page</h3>

<p>The <b>layout </b> for each page is of simple and minimalistic design in accordance to the<br>
designers preferances. a nav bar at the top of each page to allow for easy and <br>
convenient navigation between the pages with a minimalistic colour design that should <br>
make for ease of reading for all readers, including those suffering colour blindness. <br>
<br>
The <b>content</b> of each page is consistentantly ad hoc due to the nature of the <br>
questions being asked, with exceptions being made in regards to legal matters where <br>
reliable third party sources are used.  </p>



<h3> 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints
affecting websites</h3>

<p>Copywrite is one of the the legal processes to claim ownership of a digital product.
    They can be inplace as soon as the website goes live. Copyright notices are often <br>
    left at the footer of a webpage to remind/reassure users of their existance and <br>
    for how long they'll be in place.<br>
<br>
If legal protection is desired under copyright law (eg protection from copywrite infringment)<br>
then i believe you must register what you wish to copyright with the local legal authorities,<br>
usually in regards to nations (for as far as i'm personally aware there is no internationally <br>
enforced copyright law).<br>
<br>
I believe this is especially recommended for public websites as they are very vunerable to having <br>
their content copied and reused.<br>
<br>
When applying for copyright on your material it is usually wise to review a database on similar copyrighted<br>
material to endure the content is not already registered first. <br>
But presuming the product doesn't infringe on other copyrighted material it should be as simple as filling <br>
out either a paper or online applicaiton form, paying a copyright fee and then simply waiting for the <br>
application to get accepted.

Although it's legally uneccessary i'd like to credit julie-aagaard here for the background used by this website which was discovered from Pexels.

<h3>
1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into
account - describe issues that people with
disabilities may face when using webpages and
how we can overcome them</h3>

<div class="u1o1">

There are 3 major issues that people with disabilities could face when browing the internet.<br>

<ol>
    <li><b>Sight-Problems:</b> could cause significant difficulties when browsing <br>
        websites without enough contrast utilisation, i believe this can be <br>
        especially prevelant for those suffering from colour-blindness.<br>
    With this in mind all the text and links were styled to have a significant enough<br>
contrast so as to still be readable even in grayscale and by myself when not <br>
using my perscription glasses. </li><br>
<br>
<li><b>Mobility-Problems:</b> could cause significant difficulties when browsing <br>
    websites which have small links, to combat this there is a large hyperlink at<br>
the bottom of every webpage in a large print which will take the user back to the<br>
website's index/homepage where they can more easily navigate thoughout the website.</li><br>
<br>
<li><b>Cognitive-Problems</b>could cause significant difficulties when browsing <br>
    websites in a variety of ways. Creating a proffessional solution to this is <br>
sadly beyond my current ability but i have endeavoured to keep the website <br>
functionally simple so as to not only be more achieveable to produce but also easier<br>
to visually, physically and mentally navigate. I believe this website should be <br>
navicable for those with minor cognitive disabilities and for those with more <br> 
serious conditions it is being presumed they should already be recieving <br>
adequate support from other sources and may still navigate this website with <br>
third party assistance.</li>

</ol>

<h3>
1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes
for websites</h3>

<div class="u1o1">
The most appropriate filetypes for websites are .HTML and .CSS filetypes to my current <br>
understanding, though JavaScript is known to still be rather prevelant.<br>
.img, .png and .jpeg are appropriate filetypes for uploading images to a website but for <br>
a more exhaustive list this <a href="https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html"> website </a> provides a potentially interesting read.
