    <h2>Personal Review of the Webiste - Continued</h2>

<br>
<h3>  
3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools
and systems used in terms of productivity and
efficiency – could you have been more efficient
when making your website? How? Could you have
done it in teams?
</h3>
<p>

    The benefits of using a dediacted software tool such as Visual Studios Code <br>
    for coding is that it allows you to productivly and efficiently troubleshoot<br>
     errors in the code with minimal eyestrain and sacrifice to time. It can support <br>
     rapid collaboration between multiple induviduals and expose the finished product<br>
      to a wider audience.<br>
      <br>
    One of the most notable drawbacks of IT tools and systems is that they require <br>
    a degree of specialisation of knowledge to effectively use, restricting the <br>
    usability to those who are already familiar with the software or those who <br>
    are willing to invest resources to familiarise the team with the <br>
    given software/ IT tool.<br>
    <br>
    The developement of this project could have been more efficient if a more <br>
    organised approach to structuring this project was undertaken before the<br>
    coding begun. Trello was used to aid this but due to there being a vague <br>
    marking criteria and an uncomfortable emphasis on creativity and personalisation<br>
    a more brute force method was employed to encourage greater productivity with the <br>
    only minor drawback being a sacrifice of<br>
     physical, emotional and mental wellbeing from the developer.<br>
</p>
<br>

<br>
<h3>
3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and
efficiency
</h3>
<p>
It is widely debated as to the best method to administer caffiene to the brain<br>
but a steady supply of coffee and energy drinks rationed throughout the day has<br>
 proven to be one of the more reliable methods to increase productivity albeit<br>
 to the occasional detriment to efficientcy.<br>
 <br>
Some softwares/IT tools can be employed effectively to improve an induviduals <br>
productivity but aside from the ones that directly reduce the total workload <br>
of the developer it can be dismissed as a self induced placebo effect - for <br>
those who don't wish to commit to the grueling endeavour of actually<br>
 improving the function of the host's brain through the dedicated and <br>
 disciplined practice of exercise, diet, sleep and caffiene consumption.<br>

</p>
<br>

<br>
<h3>
3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity
using IT in digital projects – what would you do
differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
</h3>
<p>
The major detriment to the productivity of this project was personal health and <br>
out of work commitments. If these factors were more greatly considered prior to the<br>
undertaking of the project no improvements to productivity would have likely been needed.<br>
<br>
In regards to teamwork and slack: It may have been possible to imporve the total work load<br>
undertaken by dividing up the tasks using a communication IT tool/software such as Slack or <br>
zoom but without further dedication to organisation and project methodology the benefits may<br>
not have provided notable improvements during the span of such a short project.<br>
</p>
<br>

<br>
<h3>
    3.4 Describe he you would go about testing digital solutions.
</h3>
<p>
    Step_1():<br>
 I would go about testing digital solutions by initially actually trying to <br>
 just use them as intended:<br>
 <br>
 Step_2():<br>
 if it_works_as_intended:<br>
......Proceed_to_stress_test_to_find_its_limits<br>
......Take note of limits and call it engineered to "good_enough" and move on.
 <br>
elif it_breaks_somewhere_specific:<br>
...... Test the components related to the break to pin point the fault/s.<br>
...... Make the nesesary ammendments.<br>
...... Go back to "Step_1():"<br>
<br>
else:
......if it simply doesn't function it will likely be a matter of praying that<br>
the coding software has detected where the fault is and wishes to share this<br>
information with you.<br>
...... consider the solutions, make the alterations and proceed back to "Step_1():"
