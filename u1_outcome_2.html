<h2>Personal Review of the Webiste</h2>

<br>
<h3>
    2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change
approach as needed – in making your own
website, are you happy with the tools you used?
E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello
</h3>
<p>
    So far the tools used in this project are:<br>
    -Visual Studio Code,<br>
    -Trello,<br>
    -Slack,<br>
    -Zoom,<br>
    -Notepad,<br>
    -google chrome search engine,<br>
    -Duckduckgo search engine,<br>
    <br>
    and by the end GITHUB will be used to upload this project to the internet for review.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Visual Studio Code</b> has been very useful for writing out the code and quickly scanning for<br>
    functional mistakes. The primary drawback so far has been that it does not possess a spell<br>
    check or correction feature, so with a society that has become intimately used to <br>
    having their spelling checked for them it can be difficult to effectively review ones<br>
    own work effectively with a skill that may not have been used for many years.<br>
    The <b>Notepad</b> software was trialed for the purpose of reliable spelling but it <br>
    proved equally useless in this field.<br>
    <b>MS Office-word</b> was considered but was not within the budget for <br>
    this project to purchase.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Trello</b> was not initially considered useful for this individual project but <br>
    but was utilised as it was part of the marking criteria.<br>
    Though suprisingly it did serve the purpose in aid of chunking the project into more <br>
    manageable parts via it's checklist functtion.<br>
    <br>
    <b> Slack</b> and <b>Zoom</b> have been increadibly useful for communicating between <br>
    members of the August 17<sup>th</sup> 2020 class of Code Nation and communicating with the <br>
    illustrious "Arch-tutor Jay :  Grand Magnus of the <i>The Code</i>, esteemed capain of <br>
    the Code Nation special forces and tamer of the dreaded Python!" praise be his name.<br>
    <br>
    The <b>Google Chrome</b> and <b>DuckDuckGo</b> search engines were used throughout the <br>
    testing and trouble shooting proccess during the projects developement with further plans<br>
    being made to also test the projects functionality on "mozilla firefox" and <br>
    soemthing called a "Yahoo".<br>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
    2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were
appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen,
Trello
</h3>
<p>   
    <b>Visual Studios Code</b> seems appropriate for the given task baring the lack <br>
    of a spellcheck, though even if there was a tool with such a feature it would not<br>
     make it more appropriate to use as the most critically strained resource for this<br>
     project was the time constraint.<br>
     <br>
     The same logic can be allplied to the other it tools used.<br>
     Due to the inexperience of the developer of this proejct the tools used were the ones<br>
     that were made familliar during the compact 3 week course.<br>
     To sacrifice time to both; research for a more appropriate tool and learn how to use it,<br>
     would have been irresponsible considering both the time constraints and acceptable <br>
     degree of function of the currently familiarised IT tools.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
    2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your
    final project – are you happy with your website?
    Why? Why not? You should review it on the
    website itself in the interests of openness. What
    would you change?  
</h3>
<p> 
    <b>The Strengths;</b> of the final product is it's simplicity, the majority of <br>
    the alterations made to the style have been for readability and ease of use.<br>
    <br>
    <b>The weakneses;</b> of the final product could also be it's simplicity though... <br>
    As standards have changed over the years many if not most browsers of the internet <br>
    have come to expect pretty visuals and may often forgo the use of websites without them.<br>
    if further proof of this statement is required simply imagine how often the average user<br>
    of the internet uses google scholar to learn something compared to the regular google <br>
    browser and you'll likely find yourself agreeing.<br>
<Br>
    <b>Am <i>I</i> happy with the website?</b> <br>
    No, i'm rarely happy with my work, <br>
    especially when prolonged fatigue and personal life have intruded on the quality<br>
    of the final product, but it is sadly the current best outcome possible from 5 hours <br>
    of focused work at my current ability. Uncertain where but it is believed a couple <br>
    of bugs may have entered the code at some point resulting in some lines of code <br>
    not working as intended, one fault required a manuel re-writing to remove in <br>
    Visual Studios Code but if there is another then it currently lays undetected <br>
    causing a significant adaptaion of the intended style of the website.<br>
    <br>
    <b>What would i change?</b><br>
    If more distraction free time was possible to dedicate to this project then the <br>
    original plan of creating a parody like old-fashioned Newspaper style website would <br>
    have been persued utilising the new and exciting flex-boxes within CSS to re-create <br>
    the old tabloid style layout. Some of the original parody text was left within the <br>
    website to meet the requirement of adding some personal personality to the website.<br>
    

</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
2.4 Describe further improvements you can make
to your project
</h3>
<div class="u1o1"> 
    Aside from the desired alternative final product previously mentioned in <br>
    section 2.3 above some desireable additional further changes would be:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>altering the sizes of the paragraph boxes to better compliment the text.</li>
        <li>Replace some of the hyperlinks with sprite buttons for better visuals.</li>
        <li>To make the webpage more visually man mechanically interactive/dynamic.</li>
        <li>review the style palette used as although it's preferable for my eyesight it may not be popular in general.</li>
        <li>Include superior/improved humour into the webpage</li>
        <li>and to possibly imbed some videos or games into the webpage.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match
requirements and are fit for purpose

<p>
    Outcomes have been reviewed and all of them seem to have been covered to some <br>
    extent within the websites written material or code.<br>
